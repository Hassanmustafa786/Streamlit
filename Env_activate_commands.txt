It appears that you are encountering issues with script execution policies in PowerShell. The error indicates that running scripts is disabled on your system.

To resolve this issue, you can temporarily change the execution policy to allow script execution. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following command:

powershell:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
After running this command, try activating the virtual environment again:

powershell:
C:\Users\User\Desktop\Habibi\streamlit\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
After activating the virtual environment, you can revert the execution policy to its original state by running:

powershell:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope Process
Keep in mind that changing the execution policy can have security implications, so it's recommended to set it back to a restricted state after activating the virtual environment. If you face any issues, you might need to consult with your system administrator for permission adjustments or consider alternative approaches.


# For Python Prompt
# First run this

# then activate the environment
